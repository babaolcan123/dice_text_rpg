#Dice Text RPG
This is a Turkish text dice role playing game. It is just an amateur version for now.

It is based on a story. The player is in the dark forest and an enemy appears. They have 2 choices: Run or Fight! Based on their choice, they either give their golds and run like a coward or they fight like a hero.

If they choice the fight, the game begins. they have 3 options for fighting strategy. Aggresive, Defansive or Hiding. Whatever the player chose, the dices are rolled and fate is determined by the numbers.

This game is just a demo version. I just started learning coding and python. I wanted to try some of my thoughts and challange myself. I want to add market, items and more story too in this project. I will also do English version of this.
